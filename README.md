I am a **Software Development student** with a core focus on **Full Stack Development**. I enjoy building web applications using **PHP and JavaScript**, with a strong emphasis on creating clean and efficient backend logic.

Alongside my studies, I have a deep interest in **Cybersecurity**. I actively practice identifying and fixing web vulnerabilities to ensure the applications I build are secure by design. I am eager to apply my academic knowledge to real-world projects and continue growing as a secure-code developer.
